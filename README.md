## Installation
### Clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:sergeikuz/python-project-83.git
cd python-project-83
```
### To use the app properly you'll need to provide it with $DATABASE_URL and $SECRET_KEY vars.
To deploy the application, you need to rename the .env-sample file to .env in the root directory. After that, modify the values for SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL. It is important to insert your own values.

### After that run: make build to install all required packages and create necessary tables in the database.
```
make build
```
### Run make start to start.

```
make start
```

### Good luck and have a fun! 🤚
